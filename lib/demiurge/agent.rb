module Demiurge

  # Agents correspond roughly to "mobiles" in many games. An agent
  # isn't particularly different from other Demiurge objects, but it's
  # useful to have some helper classes for things like pathfinding.
  # Also, humans expect agents to have some finite ability to perform
  # actions over time, so it's nice to regulate how much an agent can
  # get done and how "busy" it is. This keeps an AI agent from just
  # queueing up 30 move intentions and crossing the room in a single
  # tick, for instance. It does *not* keep that same AI from having an
  # intentional 30-square move that works in a single tick, but it
  # slows the rate of actions. Agents get a single "real" intention,
  # unlike, say, rooms, which can have lots going on at once.
