  # This method loads new World File code into an existing engine.  It
  # should be passed a list of "specs", normally roughly the same list
  # that was passed to Demiurge::DSL.engine_from_dsl_files to create
  # the engine initially. A "spec" is either a single string of World
  # File DSL code, or a two-element array of the form: ["label",
  # "code"]. Each is a string. "Code" is World File DSL Ruby code,
  # while "label" is the name that will be used in stack traces.
  #
  # Options:
  #
  # * verify_only - only check for errors, don't load the new code into the engine, aka "dry run mode"
  # * guessing_okay - attempt to notice renames and modify old state to new state accordingly
  # * no_addition - if any new StateItem would be created, raise a NonMatchingStateError
  # * no_removal - if any StateItem would be removed, raise a NonMatchingStateError
  #
  # Note that if "guessing_okay" is turned on, certain cases where
  # same-type or (in the future) similar-type items are added and
  # removed may be "guessed" as renames rather than treated as
  # addition or removal.
  #
  # Where the files and world objects are
  # essentially the same, this should reload any code changes into the
  # engine. Where they are different, the method will try to determine
  # the best match between the new and old state, but may fail at
  # doing so.
  #
  # Ordinarily, this method should be called on a fully-configured,
  # fully-initialized engine with its full state loaded, in between
  # ticks.
  #
  # When in doubt, it's better to save state and reload the engine
  # from nothing. This gives far better opportunities for a human to
  # determine what changes have occurred and manually fix any errors.
  # A game's current state is a complex thing and a computer simply
  # cannot correctly determine all possible changes to it in a useful
  # way.
