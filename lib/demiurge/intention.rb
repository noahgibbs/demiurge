module Demiurge

  # An Intention is an unresolved event. Some part of the simulated
  # world "wishes" to take an action. This need not be a sentient
  # being - any change to the world should occur with an Intention
  # then being resolved into changes in state and events -- or
  # not. It's also possible for an intention to resolve to nothing at
  # all. For instance, an intention to move in an impossible direction
  # could simply resolve with no movement, no state change and no event.
  #
  # Intentions go through verification, resolution and eventually
  # notification.
  #
  # Intentions are not, in general, serializable. They normally
  # persist for only a single tick. To persist an intention for most StateItems,
  # consider persisting action names instead.
  #
  # For more details about Intention, see {file:CONCEPTS.md}.
