module Demiurge
  # A Zone is a top-level location. It may (or may not) contain
  # various sub-locations managed by the top-level zone, and it may be
  # quite large or quite small. Zones are the "magic" by which
  # Demiurge permits simulation of much larger areas than CPU allows,
  # up to and including "infinite" procedural areas where only a small
  # portion is continuously simulated.

  # A simplistic engine may contain only a small number of top-level
  # areas, each a zone in itself. A complex engine may have a small
  # number of areas, but each does extensive managing of its
  # sub-locations.
