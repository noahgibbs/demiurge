  # to accumulate and count them and possibly to deactivate one or
  # more bad scripts. Error counting can allow an administrator to
  # locate (or guess) the bad script in question and disable one or
  # more scripts to remove the problem. While it's technically
  # possible to disable bad scripts automatically, that may sometimes
  # have distressing side effects when a script was intended to run
  # and didn't. It may also have false positives where a misbehaving
  # script "frames" a correct script by causing errors downstream.
