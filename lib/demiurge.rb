  # A StateItem encapsulates a chunk of state. It provides behavior to
  # the bare data. Note that the {Demiurge::ActionItem} child class
  # makes StateItem easier to use by providing a simple block DSL
  # instead of requiring raw calls with the engine API.

  # Items a user would normally think about (zones, locations, agents,
  # etc) inherit from StateItem, often indirectly. The StateItem
  # itself might be highly abstract, and might not correspond to a
  # user's idea of a specific thing in a specific place. For example,
  # a global weather pattern across many zones is not a single
  # "normal" item. But it could be a single StateItem as the weather
  # changes and potentially reacts over time.

  # StateItems are transient and can be created, recreated or
  # destroyed without warning. They need to be hooked up to the
  # various Ruby code for their actions. The code for actions isn't
  # serialized. Instead, each action is referred to by a name scoped
  # to the item's registered name.  All item-name/action-name
  # combinations are registed in the {Demiurge::Engine} when the
  # {Demiurge::DSL} reads the Ruby World Files. This means an action
  # can be referred to by its name when serialized, but the actual
  # code changes any time the world files are reloaded.

  # For items with more convenient behavior to them see ActionItem,
  # and/or specific classes like Agent, Zone, Location and so on.

  # StateItems can be serialized at any time to "structured array"
  # format. That format consists of a set of Plain Old Ruby Objects
  # (POROs) which are guaranteed to be serializable as JSON, and thus
  # consist of only basic data structures like Strings, Arrays,
  # Booleans and Hashes. A single StateItem will serialize itself to a
  # short Array of this form: ["ObjectType", "item name",
  # state_hash]. The ObjectType is the type registered with the
  # engine, such as "ActionItem". The "item name" is the object-unique
  # item name. And the state_hash is a JSON-serializable Ruby Hash
  # with the object's current state. A dump of multiple StateItems
  # will be an Array of these Arrays.
