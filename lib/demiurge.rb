# Okay, so with state set per-object, and StateItem objects having no
# local copy, it becomes an interface question: how to write
# less-horrible code in a DSL setting to paper over the fact that the
# item doesn't control its own state, and has to be fully disposable.

# This makes it easy to run in "debug mode" where state and StateItems
# are both rotated constantly (destroyed and recreated) while allowing
# easier production runs where things can be mutated rather than
# frozen and replaced.
